# ChatBot
### Why?
I wanted to learn more about models, hugging face, and how to use them. I thought this project would be a good way to learn and practice as it uses many different models to complete its goals.

## Project Outline
 - Phase 1
    - Use a text generation model to make human-like responses
    - Somehow train/specialize the model to have a target personality (edit: this ended up being boringly easy; I thought I would have to do something).
 - Phase 2
    - Use an audio-to-text model to get input via voice.
    - Pass that input to the text generation model.
 - Phase 3
    - Use a text-to-speech model to get it to talk back
 - Phase 4
    - Plug it into a Discord bot because it would be funny.
